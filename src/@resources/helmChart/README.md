# Helm charts

Helm is an open source package manager for Kubernetes. It provides the ability to provide, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.

Charts are what Helm calls their packages of kubernetes configuration. Applying a chart is synonmyous with applying a large swath of
kubernetes configuration at once.

[Go to Helm website](https://helm.sh/)

```sh
$ arcctl create helmChart
```
