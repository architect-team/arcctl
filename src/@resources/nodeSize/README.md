# Node size

Cloud providers that enable the provisioning of VMs or [nodes](../node/) often make them available
in different sizes. These sizes have names unique to each provider, so the `nodeSize` resource helps
developers learn what sizes are available:

```sh
$ arcctl list nodeSize

$ acctl get nodeSize <id>
```
