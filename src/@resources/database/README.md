# Databases

Databases represent an database instance or cluster â€“ something with a dedicated address
that applications can access and use for data storage. The [type](../databaseType/) of
databases that can be created may vary based on which [cloud provider](../../%40providers/)
the database is created on.

```sh
$ arcctl list database

$ acctl get database <id>

$ arcctl create database

$ arcctl destroy database
```
