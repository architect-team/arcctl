# Database Clusters

Database clusters represent an database instance or cluster â€“ something with a dedicated address
that applications can access and use for data storage. The [type](../databaseType/) of
databases that can be created may vary based on which [cloud provider](../../%40providers/)
the database is created on.

```sh
$ arcctl list databaseCluster

$ acctl get databaseCluster <id>

$ arcctl create databaseCluster

$ arcctl destroy databaseCluster
```
